## Tapedeck challenge Max

To get started:

1. Create a .env.local file with ```API_KEY=replace_with_your_api_key```
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Run ```npm run dev```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Notes:
- This demo is not responsive for all devices and should be viewed on desktop
- The API used doesn't offer pagination and is not suited to be used in a production app. We don't know how many results it will return so it should be improved so we can fetch the nummer of tapes we want and we filter on the backend instead of the frontend
